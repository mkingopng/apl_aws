# Project Title & Description

## Next Lifter app
Inspired by OpenLifter but where that excellent application is avowedly 
minimalist, this app is unabashedly maximalist:

### planned features:
- AusPL specific at this time
- Enter data once
- if it can be automated, then automate it
- Online only
- Cloud infra
- Built using AWS resources, but can be tweaked to use Azure or GCP
- Integrated app for: weigh in, judging, next attempt entry, etc
- Integrated with YouTube stream
- Computer Vision to augment human judges 
- LLM & RAG to augment commentary
