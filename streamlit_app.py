This is a series of questions i found myself asking as i looked at the Open Powerlifting data. 
\nEach page attempts to answer a question stated in the plot tite, using plots of the data from Open Powerlifting.
\nThe plots are interactive: however you mouse over the plot elements to see hover text showing details of the data.
\n This is a work in progress so expect there to be ongoing additions of new questions and plots
\nPlease select a page from the left sidebar to view different analyses.
