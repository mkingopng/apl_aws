"""
This module provides testing functions to simulate local invocations of AWS
Lambda functions for adding, reading, and updating records in a DynamoDB table.
Each function in this module corresponds to a specific Lambda function and
tests its functionality independently.

The module ensures that each Lambda function ('add_record', 'read_record',
'update_record') is working as expected before being deployed to AWS Lambda.
It uses a JSON file for test event data to simulate the event payload that
Lambda functions would receive in a production environment.
